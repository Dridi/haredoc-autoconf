Hare autotools example
======================

This is a proof of concept standalone haredoc project, taking the source code
from the upstream hare repository [1] but building it with autotools. With few
tweaks, it becomes possible to build a hare program and also get the goodies
(or baddies) from autoconf and automake.

Some autotools idiomatic features that work out of the box:

- dist archives
- cross compilation
- influential variables
- VPATH builds

Testing for example is not supported because haredoc doesn't come with unit
tests and Hare's model may not match automake's very well.

To give it a try:

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $ make
    $ ./haredoc -h

Another example:

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --host=riscv64-linux-gnu
    $ make
    $ file haredoc
    haredoc: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, UCB RISC-V, [...]

It appears to integrate well enough.
